   cell_sorting

I would like to know the basics of making a model.

For example,I would expect an explanation behind the cell creation and addition of different cells?

I would expect the cell tensions to be modified by the user.

I would expect cell division and cell apoptosis in other cases.(not needed for cell sorting)

I should be able to get the values of cell tensions at each edge
